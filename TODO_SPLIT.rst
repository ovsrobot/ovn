      Convention for heading levels in OVN documentation:

      =======  Heading 0 (reserved for the title in a document)
      -------  Heading 1
      ~~~~~~~  Heading 2
      +++++++  Heading 3
      '''''''  Heading 4

      Avoid deeper levels because they do not render well.

========================
OVN/OVS Split To-do List
========================

* There are likely many unused files throughout the source tree
  since they pertain to OVS rather than OVN. These can also be removed from the
  repo.

* Someone with a decent ability to write should give the README.rst file some
  polish (or even just rewrite it. I won't be offended).

* Cleanup the acinclude.m4 and m4 folder
