/* Interface for plug providers.
 *
 * A plug provider implementation performs lookup and/or initialization of
 * ports, typically representor ports, using generic non-blocking hardware
 * interfaces.  This allows the ovn-controller to, upon the CMS's request,
 * create ports and interfaces in the chassis's Open vSwitch instances (also
 * known as vif plugging).
 *
 * This module contains the infrastructure for registering plug providers which
 * may be hosted inside or outside the core OVN repository.
